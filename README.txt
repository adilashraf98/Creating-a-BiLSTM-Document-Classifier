This script was written for a class project. With the script, I built a document classification model using four different approaches - bag-of-words with Naive Bayes classifier and BiLSTM model with Elmo and BERT elbedding layer. The document classification is an important task in natural language processing as it allows to automatically assigning topics to news articles, books, social media post, etc. We decided to work with BBC dataset that has collection of news articles and classes. This dataset has five categories, however for the purpose of our project, we will be using only three.
